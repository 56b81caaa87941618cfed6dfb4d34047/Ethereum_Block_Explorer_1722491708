    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_1": "What is a blockchain block explorer?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_1": "A blockchain block explorer is an app that allows you to view and search data on a blockchain network. It provides transparency into transactions, addresses, balances, and other on-chain activity.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_2": "How does this app help find new Ethereum blocks?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_2": "This app connects to Ethereum nodes and constantly monitors the network for new blocks as they are mined. When a new block is detected, it is immediately indexed and its data is made available for viewing and analysis within the app.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_3": "What kind of data can I see for each block?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_3": "For each Ethereum block, you can view details like the block number, timestamp, transaction count, miner, difficulty, gas used, and a list of all transactions included in that block.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_4": "Is this app only for Ethereum?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_4": "Currently this block explorer focuses on Ethereum mainnet and major EVM-compatible chains like Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, etc. However, support for additional blockchains may be added in the future.",
    "FAQ_TITLE_PLACEHOLDER_TEXT": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "FAQ_SUBTITLE_PLACEHOLDER_TEXT": "Everything you need to know about finding new Ethereum blocks",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_QUESTION_TEXT_1": "What is Ethereum?",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_1": "Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables the creation of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It uses its own cryptocurrency called Ether (ETH) to pay for transaction fees and computational services.",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_QUESTION_TEXT_2": "What are new Ethereum blocks?",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_2": "New Ethereum blocks are newly mined blocks that are added to the Ethereum blockchain. Miners compete to solve complex cryptographic puzzles, and the first to solve the puzzle gets to add a new block containing transactions to the chain.",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_QUESTION_TEXT_3": "How can I find new Ethereum blocks?",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_3": "You can use block explorers like Etherscan or apps that track the Ethereum blockchain in real-time to find new blocks as they are mined. Our app provides a user-friendly interface to monitor and get notifications for newly mined Ethereum blocks.",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_QUESTION_TEXT_4": "Why would I want to find new Ethereum blocks?",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_4": "Finding new Ethereum blocks can be useful for traders, developers, and anyone interested in monitoring the Ethereum network activity. New blocks often contain important transactions or smart contract deployments that can impact the market.",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_QUESTION_TEXT_5": "Is your app free to use?",
    "FAQ_PLACEHOLDER_ANSWER_TEXT_5": "Yes, our app is free to download and use. We may introduce premium features or a subscription model in the future, but the basic functionality of finding new Ethereum blocks will always be free.",
